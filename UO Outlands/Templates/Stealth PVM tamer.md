# Stealth PVM tamer

```
100 stealth
100 hiding
90  taming
90  animal lore
80  vet
80  magery
80  wrestle
80  arms lore
```

(idea is arms lore + wrestle for defense and stealth punch disarm for 25% additional damage (from pets)

> A disarmed creature takes 25% additional damage from all sources for 10 seconds.

> A disarmed creature has a 25% penalty to melee defense from all sources for 10 seconds"

Skulker has the best AR in class for tank damage and good dps with pack instinct, disease

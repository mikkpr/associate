Same as the Stealth Jaguar Archer, but likely much more powerful since Spider DPS is nearly 2x jaguar and has poison and web special attack.
Be sure to use at least a +20 magic weapon to make up for the tactics loss, +25 (vanq) is better.
Best is to use skill orbs to increase skill cap to 720 then GM tactics.  (cost 500k to do that as of Jan 2019)
